## emptyTrash.py
For use in Linux systems.  Empties the trash in ~/.local/share/Trash.

Removing files in Linux doesn't work the same as Windows; the files don't go
into a Trash/Recycle Bin that accumulates.  Although some Linux desktop enviro-
nments utilitize this, such as the __KDE__ Desktop.

### USAGE:  
- python emptyTrash.py
- python3 emptyTrash.py   -- if you have specified Python 3.x as such
