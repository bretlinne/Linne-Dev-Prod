## new-machine-setup
Scripts for automating installation tasks standard to setting up a new machine.  

Mostly for my own usage, and mostly work on Ubuntu.  I plan to expand their range
to work more cross-platform and eventually use Ansible to run certain playbooks of 
setup scripts.

## projects
More complicated projects requiring their own folders.  These are not necessarily
common to all environments and serve more specialized needs.

## utilities
Various scripts that are have specific uses in a variety of cases.  
* emptyTrash.py - empties trash on linux machines
* detectOS.py   - return info about OS of the machine
