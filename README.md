# Linne-Dev-Prod
Finished tools, scripts, apps, games; ready for sharing or showing.

## On Feb 1st, 2019, I found out I need to seek a new job.  
## This repo will be populated very soon.  I'm migrating scripts over
## from my production repo.  Please check back in the next 48 hours.

- scripts to move in:
---------------------
1  pyProjects / pico8-png-to-hex.py
    --converts a png file to a string of hexidecimal code consumable 
      by the pico-8 game engine.  This is because the pico-8 has a 
      limited sprite palette of 16,384 pixels.  That's 256 tiles of 
      8x8 pixels. 
    --however sprites can be encoded and drawn fron hexadecimal strings
      to stretch the amount of sprites that can be used in any project.
    --large images, such as a title screen can take up a large chunk of
      available memory can be encoded this way to increase the graphic
      capabilities of a very limited system.
